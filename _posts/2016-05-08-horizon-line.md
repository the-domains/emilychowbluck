# Horizon Line

**_Horizon Line_** is a collaboration between two artists, Emily Chow Bluck and Jennifer M. Harley. For our proposal for Art in Odd Places we will create an installation along 14th street in Manhattan around issues of redlining and gentrification.

## Context

Redlining: What is it?

In 1935, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board asked Home Owners' Loan Corporation to create "residential security maps" for 239 cities across the United States in order to denote the level of confidence in successful real-estate investments in the selected cities. Each city's neighborhoods were segmented into four types of areas: Type A (Green) were the most desirable areas to lend to, Type B (Blue) were "Still Desirable," Type C (Yellow) were considered "Declining" areas, and Type D (Red) areas were treated as risky places to invest in, particularly for mortgage support. These neighborhoods were often older areas of the city and home to populations of lower-income communities of color.\[1\]

Although the historic impetus for Redlining was to provide recommendations for banks as to where they should provide mortgages and other investments, this practice has led to a gross disinvestment in low-income neighborhoods of color. Redlining has had lasting implications on wealth inequity and neighborhood, business, and homeowner stability to this day.
